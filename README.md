# Sentiment Analysis 
I created a sentiment classifier using logistic regression in C++. I used word frequencies for feature extraction. Instead of representing word vectors as Vector of 
dimension V. I represent it using dim 3. (1, PosFreq, NegFreq). I also created a system to save Model as binary.
