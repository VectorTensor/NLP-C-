300,2451,Borderlands,1,I disagree. Psycho Krieg and the Fantastic Fustercluck is a wonderful end to the borderlands 3 dlc line that focuses on a fan favorite character and gives long lasting players closure on some very big questions of Krieg’s character and memorable set pieces players interact with.
301,2451,Borderlands,1,"Psycho Krieg and the Fantastic Fustercluck is a wonderful conclusion to the Borderlands 3 dlc line, which focuses on a fan favorite character and offers long-lasting players a conclusion on some very big issues of the character of war and memorable set pieces with which players interact."
302,2451,Borderlands,1,"""Psycho and Ostik Fusterkluck"" is the perfect conclusion to the ""Borderlands 3"" line, which focuses on the fans ""favorite character and gives the players the opportunity to close for a long time some very important questions about's character and the memorable scenery with which the players interact."
303,2451,Borderlands,1,I disagree. Psycho Krieg vs the Fantastic Fustercluck is a wonderful end game the borderlands 3 dlc line that focuses on a fan favorite character and gives long lasting players closure on some very big questions of primary character and memorable set character players play with.
304,2451,Borderlands,1,I seriously disagree. The Psycho Krieg and the Very Fantastic Fustercluck story is a wonderful end to the borderlands 3 dlc book line that focuses on a fan favorite character and gives long game lasting players closure on some very big questions of both Krieg ’ s character and the memorable set in pieces players always interact with.
305,2451,Borderlands,1,not disagree. Klaus Krieg and the Fantastic Fustercluck have a wonderful end to the borderlands 3 dlc line that focuses on this fan favorite character and gives little range satisfying closure on several very big questions of that character and memorable set pieces players interact with.
